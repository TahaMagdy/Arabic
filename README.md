### Compiling `main.cpp` for testing.
- Change the current directory to `build`.
- Then `cmake ..` to generate the `Makefile`
- then `make`.

>> I used [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/design/cpp) to process unicode strings. I compiled `ICU` as a static library and put the `.a` files in `lib` dir.
